# 🌀 Degen Spin

**Degen Spin** is Degen Park’s decentralized spin game, built for the fearless. Using **ORAO's VRF** for provable fairness, players can swap their favorite **meme coins** or use $SOL directly for a chance to win big.

---

### ⚙️ How Does It Work?

![Degen Spin Animation](/wheel.gif)

In **Degen Spin**, players can choose to participate in each round using $SOL or by auto-swapping supported memecoins into $SOL. Players deposit their chosen currency into a shared pot during the round timer. A round begins when two or more players have placed their bets. When the timer runs out:

1. The wheel spins.
2. Your win chance is based on your share of the total pot.
3. The wheel stops, and one lucky winner takes the entire pot.

**No second-place prizes, just glory and riches for the winner.**

### 📋 Example Game Round

Imagine a pot of 100 SOL, with four players contributing memecoins swapped into SOL or directly using $SOL:

| **Player** | **Deposit**  | **Chance**       |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Alice      | 40 SOL       | 40%              |
| Bob        | 30 SOL       | 30%              |
| Carol      | 20 SOL       | 20%              |
| Dan        | 10 SOL       | 10%              |

The wheel visually represents the chances, with Alice’s share being the largest and Dan’s the smallest. When the wheel stops, the winner takes home the **entire pot** (less a small protocol fee).
